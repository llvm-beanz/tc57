## Introduction

HLSL 2021 supports syntaxes and features that either do nothing, or are
potentially confusing. This proposal tracks a set of minimal breaking changes
for HLSL to remove misleading or confusing functionality.

## Motivation

This proposal is part of a larger effort to reduce carried forward technical
debt in HLSL compiler implementations.

## Proposed solution

### Removal of Effects Syntax

DXC supports parsing much of the legacy FXC effects syntax, however it emits
warnings and does not provide any behavior associated with the effects syntax.

In HLSL 202x mode, the effects parsing support should be disabled so that parsing
failures generate errors as would otherwise occur in HLSL. Conformant compilers
should not support parsing the effects syntax.

#### Examples of effects syntax

```hlsl
< int foo=1; >
<
  string Name = "texa";
  int ArraySize = 3;
>;

sampler S : register(s1) = sampler_state {texture=tex;};
Texture2D l_tex { state=foo; };

int foobar2 {blah=foo;} = 5;

texture tex1 < int foo=1; > { state=foo; };


technique T0
{
  pass {}
}
Technique
{
  pass {}
}

int foobar5[] {1, 2, 3};
int foobar6[4] {1, 2, 3, 4};
```

### Removal of `interface` Keyword

DXC supports `interface` declarations, however the semantic utility of
interfaces is limited. Instances of interfaces cannot be created or passed
around to functions. They can only be used as a static-verification that all
required methods of an object are implemented.

Template-based polymorphic patterns available in HLSL 2021 and later enable many
of the code patterns that `interface` declarations would have previously been
used for and should be the supported path going forward.

Conforming implementations will not treat the `interface` keyword as a reserved
word, and will not support any special parsing or semantic handling for
`interface` declarations. Use of the `interface` keyword as a _class-key_
in the grammar for specifying a declaration shall be rejected and produce a
diagnostic.

### Removal of `uniform` Keyword

In DXC the `uniform` keyword is parsed and ignored. This may lead users to
believing it has some impact when it does not. We should remove it.

Conforming implementations will not treat the `uniform` keyword as a reserved
word, and will not support any special parsing or semantic handling for
variables with the `uniform` type attribute applied. Use of the `uniform`
keyword as a keyword attribute on any declaration shall be rejected and produce
a diagnostic.

### Removal of `shared` Keyword

In DXC the `shared` keyword is parsed and ignored. This may lead users to
believing it has some impact when it does not. We should remove it.

## Disallow `cbuffer` initializers

DXC allows variables within a `cbuffer` to have initializer clauses. The
initializer clauses are ignored, and DXC does not issue a diagnostic. In HLSL
202x initializer clauses on declarations placed into an implicit or explicit
`cbuffer` declaration are illegal and will produce an error.

Conforming implementations shall reject initializers on declarations inside
`cbuffer` declarations and on declarations added to the implicit global
`cbuffer`.

## Detailed Design

The features referenced in this proposal are all removals, as such they do not
have any associated normative language. Each of the following documentation
sections will be added as subclauses of Annex B to explain the historical
implementations.

### Removals from [Lex.Keywords]

The keywords `sampler_state`, `interface`, `shared` and `uniform` should be
removed from the grammar for keywords.

### Legacy DirectX Features [AnnexB.LegacyDX]

The existing reference compilers support a set of features that worked in tandem
with the Direct3D runtime or other support libraries which are no longer
supported in the latest versions of Direct3D.

These features are not included in the standard, nor are they conforming
extensions, as such conforming implementation will not support these features.

#### Effects For Direct3D [AnnexB.LegacyDX.Effects]

The Effects runtime support in Direct3D 9 through Direct3D 11 relied on a set of
syntax extensions for HLSL. The latest documentation for the Direct3D 11 Effects
APIs and shader syntax is available on [Microsoft's public documentation
site](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/direct3d10/d3d10-graphics-reference-effect).

The main additions to HLSL for the Effects feature are the [annotation
syntax](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/direct3d10/d3d10-effect-annotation-syntax)
and technique declarations.

```hlsl
int MyVar <int SomeVal=42;>; // Annotated variable.
sampler S : register(s1) = sampler_state {texture=tex;};

technique10 MyRender // Technique declaration.
{
	pass RenderPass
	{
		SetVertexShader(CompileShader(vs_2_0, VSMain()));
		SetPixelShader(CompileShader(ps_2_0, PSMain()));
	}
}
```

The effects syntax has three keywords: `sampler_state`, `technique10`, and
`pass`.

#### Shader Interfaces [AnnexB.LegacyDX.Interfaces]

Direct3D 11 supported a limited level of dynamic symbol resolution based on
`interface` declarations. A shader would declare an interface containing a set
of function declarations, and any class that inherited from that interface was
required to provide definitions of all functions declared in the interface.

This functionality used in conjunction with functionality exposed in DXBC and
the Direct3D runtime could swap interface implementations at runtime enabling
code reuse and specialization.

This feature is not supported in Direct3D 12, Vulkan, nor any actively
supported shader bytecode. DXC's implementation of the `interface` keyword is
limited to static verification that objects inheriting from the interface
provide definitions for all interface members.

A conforming implementation of this standard will not support the `interface`
keyword.

### Legacy HLSL Features [AnnexB.LegacyHLSL]

The actively supported reference compiler DXC has support for parsing some HLSL
constructs that had meaning and impact in FXC's implementation, but do nothing
in DXC. These legacy language features are omitted from this standard.

#### cbuffer initializers [AnnexB.LegacyHLSL.cbuffer]

The FXC compiler captured initializers for variables in `cbuffer` declarations
into shader reflection information. This information was used by the [Effects
for Direct3D](https://github.com/Microsoft/FX11) runtime, but could also be used
directly by users.

The DXC compiler supported parsing initializers but did not capture them into
the shader reflection or any other metadata. This standard disallows
initializing variables in `cbuffer` declarations, an initializer in such a
declaration is ill-formed and a conforming implementation must issue a
diagnostic.

#### `uniform` and `shared` keyword [AnnexB.LegacyHLSL.Keywords]

The current implementation of DXC parses but ignores the `uniform` and `shared`
keywords which had meaning in earlier versions of HLSL. A conforming
implementation will not support these keywords, will treat them as identifier
tokens, and will error if they are encountered in grammar formations where
identifiers are disallowed.
