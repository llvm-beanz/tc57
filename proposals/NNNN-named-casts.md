## Introduction

This proposal introduces C++-like named casts which perform specific defined
casts and have more strict semantics than the general C-style casting syntax.

## Motivation

Long ago C++ adopted named casts to remove ambiguity around what data
transformation a cast performs. These take the forms `static_cast`,
`reinterpret_cast`, `const_cast`, `dynamic_cast`, and most recently `bit_cast`.

This proposal introduces named casts for HLSL to allow unambiguous ways to cast
values from a source type to a destination type with tight validation.

## Proposed solution

HLSL will introduce three new named cast templates, `static_cast<T>`,
`elementwise_cast<T>` and `bit_cast<T>`.

The `static_cast<T>(V)` will behave similar to the C++ `static_cast<T>(V)`
expression, except as changes are required due to other differences between C++
and HLSL. It will convert the expression `V` to the result type `T`. The main
difference from C++ is that HLSL's `static_cast<T>` will always produce an
rvalue since HLSL does not have spellable lvalue reference types, and may not be
used for polymorphic casts for the same reason.

The `elementwise_cast<T>(V)`, will perform an element-wise conversion
(\ref{Conv.Flat}). The type of the expression `V` and the result type `T` must
be scalar layout compatible (\ref{Basic.Types.Scalarized}).

The `bit_cast<T>(V)` cast operator will convert the expression `V` to type `T`
without modifying the precise bit representation. The type of the expression `V`
and the result type `T` must not be intangible types
(\ref{Basic.Types.Intangible}), and must be of the same size.
